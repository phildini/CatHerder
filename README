Here are some friendly commands you can use for automating ssh-based network operations.

INSTALL:

$ sudo ./install.sh

and you're done!

USAGE:

$ fab is_up 
(checks if the hosts in the hosts file are up and reachable)

$ fab host_type
(returns the host type of every host in the hosts file)

$ fab shutdown
(shuts down all hosts in the hosts file)

$ fab key_copy
(tries to copy your id_rsa.pub to all hosts in the hosts file, so that you can log in without a password.
Note that you must first generate a key with $ ssh-keygen -t rsa)

HOSTS FILE:
To define the hosts you want to run against, edit the hosts file with a full host string, eg:

root@192.168.1.1

Note that the user must be a user you have access to, and you need the full user@host for this script to work. 

Have fun!
